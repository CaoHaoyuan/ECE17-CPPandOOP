Skateboarding is exhilarating: you can move quickly and fly through the
air! Before you can do amazing tricks in the air, though, you need to learn
the basics of skateboarding, and be prepared for a lot of trial and error.
The first thing you need to do is get a skateboard. It is probably best to
talk with a skateboarder to find a store that sells good quality skateboards, not just
toys. Many skateboarders create their own setup, but for your first board, someone
at a skate shop should be able to help you. A helmet, elbow pads,
knee pads, and wrist guards are important to get, as well. It is better to wear
all of those than to hurt yourself! Once you are ready to learn tricks, you might
also need to buy some skate shoes. Then you will need to find a place to skateboard.

An empty parking lot (with a safe adult around) or your driveway are good places to start.
Skate parks are popping up in many towns now, so try to find one near you! Wherever
you go, though, make sure it is a place where skateboarding is allowed.

There are some basic movements you will need to learn in order to
skateboard. The first movement is to find your stance. Most skateboarders
put their left foot towards the front of the board and use their right foot to
push themselves. If you are left handed, you might want to try standing in a
goofy stance, with your right foot towards the front of the board and using
your left foot to push. Make sure your foot is not all the way at the front of the
board, or it will tip forward.

Next, you will want to practice how to push off the ground and glide along on
the board. Make sure most of your weight is over your front foot so that you
can balance as your back foot pushes. Push off of your back foot and
balance as the board moves. Balancing on the board as it is moving might
take some time to get used to, so make sure you are comfortable balancing
before you move on!

Once you get used to balancing with your weight over your front foot, you
can practice shifting your weight while you are on the moving skateboard.
After you push off, practice putting your back foot on the board and shifting
your weight so that you have equal weight in each foot. Then practice
shifting your weight back over your front foot so that you can push with your
back foot again.

Braking is another important movement. You use your back foot to brake, just
like you use it to push. Let the bottom of your back foot drag along the ground
to slowly bring you to a stop. Make sure you are moving slowly at first so that you
get better at judging how much force you need to put on your back foot to brake.

Last, practice how to get off the board. Once your board is stopped, with
your back foot on the ground, transfer your weight to your back foot and
take your front foot off the board. Tada! You took your first ride on a
skateboard! Keep practicing all of these basic movements slowly, until
you are very comfortable doing them. Then, try them at a faster speed. Once
you are confident in these basic moves, then you can start to learn cool
tricks! Make sure that you are always wearing your protective gear, and that
there is an adult nearby in case you fall.

Happy skateboarding!

This article is about repetition in journal articles and it has been taken from Charlesworth Author Services.

Many authors and researchers worry that their writing is too repetitive,
but repetition can be a useful tool when used correctly. It is important
in developing academic manuscripts, benefits readers, and is encouraged
(in appropriate contexts) by editors and publishers.

Repeating key words and phrases throughout a manuscript is a good way to link
ideas, making sure that each point relates to the core argument of the paper.
This repetition sharpens the focus of the manuscript and results in a more
cohesive article: the author is less likely to stray off-topic, and it is
easier for the reader to follow the author's argument as it builds towards
a conclusion.

The key to using repetition effectively is to ensure that it adds something to
the manuscript. Repetition that reinforces an argument or supports a new idea,
as described above, is useful and helps both the author and the reader.
Repeating text and data without adding value only serves to add length, something
that can annoy readers (who have to waste time reading unnecessary text) and
imples that the author has not researched or planned their paper in sufficient
detail and must reuse material to fill space. It can also be problematic if
there are word count limits for the article type.

As an author, you should use repetition sparingly when writing your conclusions.
Although it is important to restate the hypothesis and summarize your evidence,
you should avoid repeating what has already been said. Instead, you should
reintroduce your hypothesis (without quoting it directly) before giving a brief
summary of the key points that have been made as a result of your research findings.

Some journals also expect authors to discuss the implications of their conclusion
or suggest possibilities for further research. Check the journal guidelines and
other papers to see if including this information is appropriate; doing so is a
good way to develop a conclusion without relying on reusing content.

Most other forms of repetition are unnecessary and can easily be avoided.
If a manuscript makes frequent references to a long scientific name or
organization, it is good practice to introduce an abbreviation at first
use and then use said abbreviation for the rest of the article.

In addition to repeating text and data in a single manuscript, authors
should also be mindful of industry expectations when it comes to repeating
text and data from published work in new material. Repetition of this nature
can lead to self-plagiarism, but is acceptable if properly cited and used to
support new ideas and arguments. You can also reuse text and data if you are
creating a secondary publication aimed at a different group of readers than
the first publication and have the approval of the editors of both journals.

Using data from the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument on NASA's rover Curiosity,
researchers have found that certain minerals in rocks at Gale Crater the hundred and fifty km wide
ancient basin that Curiosity is exploring, may have formed in an ice covered lake
during a cold stage sandwiched between warmer periods, or after Mars lost most of its atmosphere and
began to turn permanently cold. Their findings appear in the journal Nature Astronomy.

Gale Crater was selected as the Curiosity landing site because it had signs of past water,
including clay minerals. Indeed, while exploring the base of Mount Sharp, a mountain in the center
of the crater, the rover found a three hundred and four thick layer of sediment that was deposited
as mud in ancient lakes.

To form that much sediment an incredible amount of water would have flowed down into those lakes
for millions to tens of millions of warm and humid years. But some geological features in the crater
also hint at a past that included cold, icy conditions.

Dr. Heather Franz, a geochemist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said that at some point,
Mars surface environment must have experienced a transition from being warm and humid to being
cold and dry, as it is now, but exactly when and how that occurred is still a mystery.

Factors such as changes in Mars' obliquity and the amount of volcanic activity could have
caused the Martian climate to alternate between warm and cold over time. This idea is supported by
chemical and mineralogical changes in Martian rocks showing that some layers formed in colder environments
and others formed in warmer ones.

Dr. Franz and colleagues found evidence for a cold ancient environment after the Sample Analysis at Mars
instrument extracted carbon dioxide and oxygen from thirteen dust and rock samples.

After Curiosity fed rock and dust samples into the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument, the lab heated
each one to nine hundred degrees Celsius to liberate the gases inside. By looking at the oven temperatures
that released carbon dioxide and oxygen, scientists could tell what kind of minerals the gases were
coming from. This type of information helps them understand how carbon is cycling on Mars.

Various studies have suggested that Mars ancient atmosphere, containing mostly carbon dioxide, may have
been thicker than that of Earth is today. Most of it has been lost to space, but some may be stored in
rocks at the planet's surface, particularly in the form of carbonates, which are minerals made of
carbon and oxygen.
