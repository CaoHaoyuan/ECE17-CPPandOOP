Skateboarding is exhilarating: you can move quickly and fly through the
air! Before you can do amazing tricks in the air, though, you need to learn
the basics of skateboarding, and be prepared for a lot of trial and error.
The first thing you need to do is get a skateboard. It is probably best to
talk with a skateboarder to find a store that sells good quality skateboards, not just
toys. Many skateboarders create their own setup, but for your first board, someone
at a skate shop should be able to help you. A helmet, elbow pads,
knee pads, and wrist guards are important to get, as well. It is better to wear
all of those than to hurt yourself! Once you are ready to learn tricks, you might
also need to buy some skate shoes. Then you will need to find a place to skateboard.
